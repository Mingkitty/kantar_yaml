  Survey data for smartphones from an ownership perspective. Each record represents a survey response from smartphone owners, including demographic data and purchase details.
  - Most measures have specific requirements, these are mentioned in those measure's use_when.
  General Instructions:
  - Use separate data pulls for each comparison group. Comparison is indicated through, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, the use of words like 'vs', 'between', 'compared', etc.
  - For example, when asked for top retailers for Samsung men aged 20-30 vs google vs average, perform three data pulls:
  1. Filtered for Samsung, men and age in the range of 20-30.
  2. Filtered for Google
  3. An unfiltered average.
always_clarify:
  - ALWAYS STATE YOUR ASSUMPTION ABOUT PERSPECTIVE, in this case ownership.
  - "ALWAYS ensure that **quarterly_periods** and **country** are specified or clarified in the user's question. If no quarterly_periods is mentioned, assume '2024Q3', the latest quarter. Once these have been confirmed, there is NO NEED to ask for confirmation again for follow up questions."
  - "ALWAYS INFORM (DO NOT ASK) USER ABOUT THESE THE ASSUMPTIONS **IF** YOU MAKE THEM IN **THESE EXACT WORDS**: 1 - 'Perspective: I'll assume this question is from an ownership perspective unless you specify otherwise.', 2 - 'Quarterly Period: I'll assume '2024Q3', the latest quarter, unless you specify otherwise.'"
